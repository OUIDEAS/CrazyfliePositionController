# CrazyfliePositionController

This branch is based on CFcontrol_NoClient, unlike the master branch which requres use of the CrazyFly client.

The programs in this branch will allow you to create a set of waypoints for CrazyFly, which uses a feedback loop from the Vicon
for guidance. READ THE USER GUIDE BEFORE STARTING, EXPECIALLY IF YOU HAVE NEVER FLOWN THE DRONES/USED THE VICON BEFORE.
